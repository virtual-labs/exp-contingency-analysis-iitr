### Procedure for Contingency Analysis -  

<b>STEP 1</b>: Enter the number of buses in a power system. Then, click on the "Generate Bus Table" and fill the details of buses i.e., Bus Type (Slack Bus = 1, PV Bus = 2, PQ Bus = 3), Voltage magnitude (pu), Angle (degree) , Pgen (pu), Pload (pu).
<br>
<b>Note:</b> Bus data for two standard IEEE bus systems are provided- (I) IEEE 5-Bus system and (II) IEEE 14-Bus system. To access the data click on the button of Autofill Bus Data: IEEE 5-Bus or Autofill Bus Data: IEEE 14-Bus. Also, make sure that the entered data is accurate. 
<br>
<br>
<b>STEP 2</b>: Enter the number of lines in a power system. Then, click on the "Generate Line Table" and fill the details of lines i.e., From Bus, To Bus, X (pu), line limit (pu).  
Note: Line data for two standard IEEE bus systems are provided- (I) IEEE 5-Bus system and (II) IEEE 14-Bus system. To access the data click on the button of Autofill Line Data: IEEE 5-Bus or Autofill Line Data: IEEE 14-Bus. 
<br>
<br>
<b>STEP 3</b>: Click on "Calculate B-Bus matrix for DC (Linear) Power Flow". The values of the B-Bus matrix will be displayed.
<br>
<br>
<b>STEP 4</b>: Click on "Run DC (Linear) Power Flow: Base Case". Buses data: Bus Type, Voltage magnitude (pu), Angle (degree), Pgen (pu), Pload (pu), Line flows data: Pline (pu), will be displayed.
<br>
<br>
<b>STEP 5</b>:  Click on "Run Contingency Analysis: Line Outages". Results for line outage contingency analysis will be displayed. The number of overloaded transmission lines will be displayed in red colour.
<br>
<br>
<b>STEP 6</b>:  Click on "Run Contingency Analysis: Generator Outage". Results for bus voltage angle and generator output as well as line flows will be displayed. The number of overloaded transmission lines will be displayed in red colour.
